        <h2> a circlular economy project. </h2>
        <p>Sustainability is easy to talk about but much harder to actually put into practice. Where do you start? Perhaps the best place is to focus on what we all have in common. It would be difficult to live in Leipzig without clothes. The fashion industry comes in near the top of the list of most polluting industries and has a long history of abusive working conditions. We need to take back control of the manufacturing process. We need need to support local producers and learn how to sew clothes ourselves. </p>

        This project aims to promote community skill sharing. For many, gone are the days where we can sit next to our grandma and pick up tips but we can't afford to pay for many courses to learn all the skills. Youtube and teaching websites are not the same as sitting togeather drinking tea. There are many people in the city who have expert knowledge of clothes making and many more who want to learn. This project aims to build networks, encourage creativity and provide a directory of locally produced clothes on the market. </p>
